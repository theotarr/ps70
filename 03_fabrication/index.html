        <h1>Week 3: Hand Tools & Fabrication</h1>

        <p>
          For this week's fabrication assignment, I built a device to balance a marble on the edge
          of a platform. The goal was to experiment with hand tools and fabrication using laser-cut
          cardboard components for the main structure and hand-crafted elements for the motor
          integration and cam mechanism.
        </p>

        <h2>Design and Laser Cutting</h2>
        <p>
          Building on the 2D design skills developed in
          <a href="../02_2Ddesign/index.html">Week 2</a>, I used Fusion to model the base, track,
          rails, and mounting piece for the track. The laser cutting process was straightforward: I
          exported the designs as .DXF files and ran them through the cutter. This produced clean
          edges, allowing for a flexible frame that could support the rotation of the cam, pushing
          the track up and down.
        </p>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>
        <p>
          Once cut the pieces were easy to assemble. I glued the base and rails together, forming
          the core frame. I attached the track using the mounting piece and tabs with hot glue. This
          was ideal for quick prototyping due physical flexibility, which was particularly helpful
          in accommodating the subtle motor movements without rigid constraints. At this stage, the
          structure was ready for the the motor and cam system.
        </p>

        <h2>Iterating on Motor Mount and Cam Setup</h2>

        <p>
          The most challenging part was integrating the DC motor and crafting the cam to precisely
          control the platform's tilt, ensuring the marble teeters on the very edge without falling.
          Rather than relying solely on digital modeling for these irregular components, I used hand
          tools like scissors and a razor for quick tests.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each iteration focused on alignment: the motor needed to be positioned so its shaft drove
          the cam without wobbling and pushed up the track enough that the marble wouldn't fall. I
          settled on a design that used a simple bracket glued to the frame, providing stable
          mounting.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the cam itself, I experimented with different eccentric shapes. The key was achieving
          a subtle oscillation - too much tilt and the marble rolls off, too little and it doesn't
          balance dramatically. Through trial and error, attaching and detaching prototypes with
          tape, I refined the cam until the marble hovered perfectly on the edge during the peak of
          each rotation. This approach allowed for quick feedback loops that digital simulation
          couldn't match at this scale.
        </p>

        <h2>Demo</h2>

          Here's a short video demo of the mechanism in action, powered by the power test bench:

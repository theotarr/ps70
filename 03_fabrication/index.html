        <h1>Week 3: Fabrication</h1>

        <p>
          For this week's fabrication assignment, I built a mechanical device to balance a marble on
          the edge of a cam-driven platform. The goal was to create a stable yet dynamic setup using
          laser-cut cardboard components for the main structure and hand-crafted elements for the
          motor integration and cam mechanism.
        </p>

        <h2>Design and Laser Cutting</h2>

        <p>
          Building on the 2D design skills developed in
          <a href="../02_2Ddesign/index.html">Week 2</a>, I used Fusion to model the base, track,
          rails, and mounting piece for the track. These pieces were optimized for the laser
          cutter's material constraints—using 3mm cardboard—to ensure precise fits for assembly
          without additional fasteners.
        </p>

        <p>
          The laser cutting process was straightforward: I exported the designs as .DXF files and
          ran them through the cutter. This produced clean edges and interlocking joints, allowing
          for a sturdy frame that could support the dynamic motion required for the marble
          balancing.
        </p>

        <h2>Assembly</h2>

        <p>
          Once cut, assembly was easy. The base and rails slotted together seamlessly, forming the
          core frame. I attached the track using the pre-designed mounting piece and tabs with hot
          glue. This method was ideal for quick prototyping due to its ease of use and physical
          flexibility, which was particularly helpful in accommodating the subtle motor movements
          without rigid constraints. At this stage, the structure was rigid and ready for the
          mechanical heart: the motor and cam system, which would be hand-crafted.
        </p>

        <h2>Iterating on Motor Mount and Cam Setup</h2>

        <p>
          The most challenging part was integrating the DC motor and crafting the cam to precisely
          control the platform's tilt, ensuring the marble teeters on the very edge without falling.
          Rather than relying solely on digital modeling for these irregular components, I used hand
          tools like scissors and a razor for quick tests.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each iteration focused on alignment: the motor needed to be positioned so its shaft drove
          the cam without wobbling and pushed up the track enough that the marble wouldn't fall.
          After about five prototypes, I settled on a design that used a simple bracket glued to the
          frame, providing stable mounting.
        </p>

        <p>
          For the cam itself, I experimented with different eccentric shapes. The key was achieving
          a subtle oscillation—too much tilt and the marble rolls off; too little and it doesn't
          balance dramatically. Through trial and error, attaching and detaching prototypes with
          tape, I refined the cam until the marble hovered perfectly on the edge during the peak of
          each rotation. This approach allowed for quick feedback loops that digital simulation
          couldn't match at this scale.
        </p>

        <h2>Demo</h2>

        <p>
          Here's a short video demo of the mechanism in action, powered by the power test bench:

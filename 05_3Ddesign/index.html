        <h1>Week 5 — 3D Design, Printing, and Scanning</h1>

        <h2>Tesseract Design in Fusion</h2>
        <p>
          This week's primary challenge was to design and 3D print a tesseract, which is a
          three-dimensional projection of a four-dimensional hypercube. Essentially, it's a cube
          nested within another cube, connected by edges that create a fascinating optical illusion
          of depth and impossible geometry. My goal was to create a visually compelling model that
          highlighted this nested structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          I used Fusion for the design, starting with a simple cube and then leveraging its robust
          sketching and extrusion tools to create the inner cube and the connecting framework. The
          process involved precise measurements and careful alignment to ensure the illusion would
          be effective when printed. I focused on clean lines and consistent spacing to maintain the
          aesthetic integrity of the design.
        </p>

        <h3>Printing and Post-Processing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Printing took about 45 minutes using organic supports thanks to a suggestions from
            Bobby.
          </li>
          <li>
            It was rather difficult to remove the supports and more cleanup work is needed to make
            the final product look better, but minimal organic supports popped off with pliers. I
            love when that happens.
          </li>
          <li>Some light sanding might be needed to make the final product look better.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="mt-12">Final Result</h2>
        <p>
          This print doesn't look quite right in the photo booth for some reason, but (I think) it
          nails the nested-cube illusion -- my eyes bounce between the frame and the inner cube.
          It’s a small trinket that reminds me of my favoriate movies Interstellar and the Marvel
          movies.

        <h2 class="mt-12">3D Model Viewers</h2>
        <p>
          Want to poke around the meshes yourself? Below are interactive viewers for the tesseract
          and a 3d scan I made of my most prized possession, the Flipper Zero. Spin, zoom, and judge
          my fillets yourself.

        <h2 class="mt-12">3D Scanning: Flipper Zero</h2>
        <p>
          I scanned my Flipper Zero using the lab's 3D scanner. It took a few tries to get usable
          results, since the device's reflective screen and infrared emitter made it tricky for the
          scanner to pick up certain details cleanly.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make the scanned mesh viewable in the online viewer (viewstl.com), I had to reduce the
          size of the STL file below 30&nbsp;MiB. For that, I used the

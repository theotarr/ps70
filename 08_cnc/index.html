        <h1>Week 8 — CNC: Making My Own Plates (So I Can Stop “Borrowing” from Annenberg)</h1>

        <p>
          The assignment this week was all about
          <a
            href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/ps70/07_cnc/index.html"

            >CNC machining</a
          >
          — design something in CAD/CAM and machine it on the ShopBot. I decided to turn a small
          moral dilemma into a design brief: rather than “borrowing” plates and silverware from the
          Annenberg dining hall, I would fabricate my own. If I can make a plate I actually like,
          maybe I’ll stop sneaking dishes back to my dorm.
        </p>

        <h2>Designing the plate in Aspire</h2>
        <p>
          I modeled a simple oval plate directly in Aspire. The workflow felt very approachable: set
          the stock, sketch the oval, add a shallow pocket for the surface, and a raised rim for
          that classic plate feel. Aspire’s 3D preview and doing an "air cut" helped me make sure I
          would get what I wanted.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Material: plywood panel</li>
          <li>Operations: pocket (interior), profile (outside)</li>
          <li>Export: ShopBot toolpaths from Aspire</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Cutting on the ShopBot</h2>
        <p>
          I clamped the sheet, zeroed the axes, and sent the Aspire toolpaths to the ShopBot. The
          cut took about <strong>50 minutes</strong>.
        </p>

          </a>
          <figcaption class="text-sm text-neutral-400">
            ShopBot in action — the Aspire toolpaths carved a clean pocket and rim for the mold.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>Post‑processing the CNC mold</h2>
        <p>
          After the cut I cleaned up the blank so the vacuum pull would register cleanly and not
          catch on fuzzy edges.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Belt sander:</strong> Knocked off the tabs and trued the outer profile with
          light passes to avoid rounding the reference plane.</li>
          <li><strong>Hand sanding:</strong> Used high grit inside the tight fillet and along the rim
          where the orbital can’t reach; slightly eased the top edge.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A quick dust‑off with a tack cloth made a bigger difference than expected — the smoother
          surface produced noticeably cleaner definition in the final vacuum form.
        </p>

        <h2>Vacuum forming: a few tries to get it right</h2>
        <p>
          With the wooden mold done, I moved to the vacuum former to pull a plastic plate. This part
          took experimentation. My first attempts were either under‑heated (soft corners, poor
          definition) or a little too droopy (webbing near the rim). After tweaking heat time and
          putting a lot of pressure for about 30 seconds with the vacuum, I finally got a clean form
          that captured the rim nicely.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project scratched two itches at once: learning the full Aspire → ShopBot → vacuum
          form pipeline, and easing my conscience about dishes. I now have a functional plate I made
          myself, and a workflow I can iterate on for different sizes or tray shapes. Next time I’d
          like to try a food‑safe coating on a wooden version, or thermoform a thicker sheet for
          durability.
